## Privacy policy for HowMuchAh

This is a expense tracking app for Android!

I'm trying to build my own expense tracking app which can fulfill my daily expense record.
Along the way I'm building the application, I found that, this might benefit to others that wanted to have the same features as mine, thus, I decided to post it to Google Play Store.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All expenses data is stored in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Ricky, Malaysia.
